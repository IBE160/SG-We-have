# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-27
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** User Problems and Pain Points for motivated university students
**Session Goals:** To identify challenges faced by motivated university students at any stage of their studies, and refine MVP features to address them.

**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, Brainstorming (Solution Generation)

**Total Ideas Generated:** Approximately 15-20 distinct ideas/refinements for MVP features.

### Key Themes Identified:


*   **Root Cause:** Motivated university students often lack the time or energy, when actively studying or taking notes, to critically evaluate or envision improvements for their tools. They tend to stick with what's available or what their peers use.
*   **MVP Imperative:** Core MVP features must be *irresistibly practical* from day one to overcome student inertia and encourage adoption.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys Analysis: User Problems and Pain Points
*   **Problem:** Motivated university students lack reliable study tools and have to use multiple tools/websites simultaneously.
*   **Why 1:** Because no one develops practical tools.
*   **Why 2:** Because students have a tendency to only use what's available, even though imperfect.
*   **Why 3:** Because students tend to use tools that others in their studies use, and don't think any further about what could potentially be better.
*   **Why 4:** Because of laziness and a "group" mentality where they follow what one person suggests.
*   **Why 5 (Root Cause):** Students don't have the time or energy, when practicing or taking notes, to think about what features could improve their tools or "what could be better or different."

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities (MVP Features refined to address Root Cause)

**Note-taking Interface (Rich Text Editor):**
*   **Essential Formatting:** Bold, italic, number list, bullet list, heading (h1, h2, h3), font size, font type.
*   **AI Robustness:** AI must generate quizzes effectively from free-form notes, minimizing student effort in structuring.
*   **Seamless Connection:** Clear "Generate Quiz" buttons on both single lecture page and lecture notes overview page.

**AI Study Buddy (Quiz Generation):**
*   **Quality Focus:** Quizzes must be relevant, understandable, honest, supportive, straight to the point, and fact-based.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** AI should fact-check online and use context-relevant online information to ensure questions are accurate and contextually sound.
*   **Question Types:** Focus on definitions, application, and comparison.
*   **Flexibility:** User choice (5-30 questions) or "Auto" option for length.

**Quiz Interface:**
*   **Learning-Centric Feedback:** Fact-based descriptions for correct answers.
*   **Motivation & Practice:** Score summary encourages re-taking/new quizzes; post-quiz options for "Retake same quiz" or "Generate new quiz from same notes."
*   **User Experience:** Progress bar for orientation.
*   **Micro-learning:** "Want to learn more?" option with 1-3 factual sentences.
*   **User Control:** "Skip question" option for irrelevant questions (not counted in score).

### Future Innovations (Nice-to-have features)

*   Smart Note Templating with Auto-structuring
*   On-the-Fly AI Key Point Extraction/Summary
*   Seamless Group Study Integration (Shared Note Sections/Quiz Pools) - including sharing playable quizzes and quiz summaries.

### Moonshots

(No specific moonshots identified in this session)

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Note-taking Interface

- Rationale: It is foundational; we need it to work to make the second step (AI Study Buddy/Quiz Generation) work.
- Next steps:
    1. UI/UX Design & Wireframing for editor, quiz buttons, and overview page.
    2. Rich Text Editor Component Selection & Basic Integration (Next.js/React, Tailwind).
    3. Basic Note Persistence (Supabase data model, FastAPI endpoint, frontend connection).
- Resources needed: UX/UI Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Solution Architect.
- Timeline: UI/UX Design & Component Selection in Week 44; Basic Integration & Data Model in Week 45; Frontend-Backend Persistence Connection in Week 46.

#### #2 Priority: AI Study Buddy/Quiz Generation

- Rationale: It is the logical next step and order of priority, directly dependent on the Note-taking Interface and a core value proposition.
- Next steps:
    1. AI Model Integration & Initial Prompt Engineering (Gemini Flash 2.5, FastAPI).
    2. External Fact-Checking Mechanism (Proof of Concept).
    3. Quiz Data Model & API Endpoint (Supabase, FastAPI).
- Resources needed: Backend Developer (strong in AI/ML/prompt engineering), Backend Developer (for fact-checking/APIs).
- Timeline: Primarily Week 45 (architecture/setup) and Week 46 (implementation/testing), commencing after Note-taking Interface completion.

#### #3 Priority: Quiz Interface

- Rationale: It is the direct user-facing component that delivers the value generated by the Note-taking Interface and the AI Study Buddy, dependent on the AI's output.
- Next steps:
    1. UI/UX Design & Flow Definition (question display, feedback, progress bar, "learn more", score summary, post-quiz options).
    2. Frontend Component Development (Next.js/React for interactive quiz elements).
    3. Integration with Quiz Data & Backend API (fetching quizzes, displaying explanations, submitting results).
- Resources needed: UX/UI Designer, Frontend Developer.
- Timeline: UI/UX Design in Week 44; Frontend Component Development & Integration in Week 46.

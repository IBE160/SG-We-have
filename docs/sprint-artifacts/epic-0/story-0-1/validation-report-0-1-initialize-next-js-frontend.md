# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 0-1-initialize-next-js-frontend - Initialize Next.js Frontend
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 1)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
(None)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Task-AC Mapping Missing**: Tasks are listed, but they do not explicitly reference which AC they satisfy (e.g., missing `(AC: #1)`).
   - Evidence: "Run `npx create-next-app...`" vs expected "Run `npx create-next-app...` (AC: #1)"

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
1. **Change Log Missing**: The `Change Log` section is missing from the end of the document.

## Successes
- **Requirements Traceability**: Acceptance Criteria match the source documents (Epics/Tech Spec) perfectly.
- **Source Document Coverage**: All key documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, Tech Spec) are correctly cited.
- **Structure**: Story follows the correct template and format.
- **Dev Notes**: Specific and actionable, not generic.
- **Continuity**: Correctly identified as the first story (no previous story section needed).

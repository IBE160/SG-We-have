## Successes

- **Source Document Coverage:** All relevant technical specifications and foundational documents (`tech-spec-epic-3.md`, `epics.md`, `architecture.md`, `PRD.md`) are now correctly cited, establishing clear traceability.
- **Previous Story Continuity:** The "Learnings from Previous Story" section effectively captures architectural and component-level insights from `story-2-4-auto-timestamp-notes`, ensuring continuity without reinventing solutions. The citation path has been corrected.
- **Requirements Traceability:** Acceptance Criteria are clearly defined and traceable to both the Epic breakdown (`epics.md`) and the Technical Specification (`tech-spec-epic-3.md`).
- **Dev Notes Quality:** Dev Notes provide specific guidance on architectural patterns, component locations, and UI library consistency, grounded in the project's existing structure and previous learnings.
- **Task-AC Mapping:** Every Acceptance Criterion has corresponding Frontend and Testing tasks, including specific testing subtasks to ensure verification.
- **Structure:** The story adheres to the specified structure for user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks, and metadata, with a "drafted" status and properly initialized sections.

- **Traceability:** Acceptance Criteria are explicitly mapped to Tasks, and technical requirements are traced back to the Tech Spec and Architecture documents.
- **Continuity:** The "Learnings from Previous Story" section correctly references Story 0.4 and the new `README.md` guidance, ensuring smooth transition from setup to implementation.
- **Documentation Depth:** "Dev Notes" provide specific, actionable guidance on Source Tree components and Architecture patterns (Data Flow, Monorepo).
- **Testing Strategy:** A dedicated testing task group ("AC 1-9: Manual Verification") clearly defines the definition of done.

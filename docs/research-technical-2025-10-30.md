## 6. Trade-off Analysis and Decision Factors

The top 3 decision factors for this project are:

1.  **Cost**: Free, utilizing the school-provided Gemini 2.5 Flash API.
2.  **Performance**: As performative as possible without exhausting the context window.
3.  **Accuracy and Relevance of AI-generated content**: Ensuring the quizzes generated by the AI are factually correct, directly relevant to the student's notes, and provide meaningful learning opportunities.

The chosen stack demonstrates strong alignment with these factors. The open-source nature of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and FastAPI, combined with Supabase's freemium model and the school-provided Gemini API, addresses the cost requirement. All technologies are known for their performance, and Gemini Pro 2.5's capabilities are directly aligned with the need for accurate and relevant AI-generated content.

## 7. Use Case Fit Analysis

The selected technologies fit the use case exceptionally well, meeting all identified "must-haves":

1.  **AI must generate non-trivial quizzes with external/factual context**: Directly addressed by Google Gemini Pro 2.5's advanced reasoning and factual retrieval capabilities.
2.  **App must run as a responsive web app in the browser (desktop)**: Achieved through Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
3.  **Simple user authentication and per-user storage**: Provided efficiently by Supabase.
4.  **API layer for preprocessing notes**: FastAPI serves as the controlled API layer for this purpose.
5.  **Frontend fast to build and consistent in UI**: Enabled by Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## 8. Real-World Evidence

The chosen stack is a popular and proven combination for modern web applications, especially those integrating AI. Next.js and Tailwind CSS are widely adopted for performant and visually appealing frontends. FastAPI is a strong choice for backend APIs, particularly with Python's AI/ML ecosystem. Supabase provides robust authentication and data management. Google Gemini Pro 2.5 is integrated for advanced AI capabilities, with various integration methods available (Next.js API routes, FastAPI backend). This modular stack allows for efficient development and scalable production systems, with numerous real-world examples and active communities supporting each technology.

## 9. Architecture Pattern Research

For this project, a simple, modular, service-oriented architecture is planned, with clear separation between frontend (Next.js), API gateway/orchestrator (FastAPI), managed backend services (Supabase for auth + database), and an AI service layer (within FastAPI, calling Gemini). This approach is akin to a monolithic or modular-monolith web application, prioritizing simplicity and modularity for the initial version. More complex patterns like event-driven architectures will be considered in future iterations if needed.

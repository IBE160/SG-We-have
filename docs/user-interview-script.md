**I. Introduction (5 minutes)**

*   "Hi [Participant Name], thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is [Your Name/Agent Name], and I'm working on a project to develop a new website aimed at helping students with their studies."
*   "The purpose of this interview is to understand your experiences with note-taking, studying, and preparing for exams. There are no right or wrong answers, and your honest feedback is incredibly valuable to us. Everything you share will be kept confidential and used solely for research purposes."
*   "Do you have any questions before we begin? Are you comfortable with me taking notes during our conversation?"

**II. Background & Current Study Habits (10 minutes)**

1.  "Could you tell me a bit about your current academic program and year of study?"
2.  "How do you typically take notes during lectures or when studying from textbooks/materials? (e.g., physically, digitally, specific apps/tools)"
    *   *Follow-up:* "What do you like/dislike about your current note-taking methods?"
3.  "When it comes to preparing for assignments or exams, what are your primary study methods?"
    *   *Follow-up:* "Do you use quizzes or self-testing as part of your study routine? If so, how do you create or access them?"

**III. Problem Validation & Needs (10 minutes)**

1.  "You mentioned how you currently prepare for exams. Have you ever found yourself using multiple different websites or tools for note-taking and then for creating quizzes or practicing?"
    *   *If yes:* "Could you describe that experience? What challenges or frustrations did you encounter when switching between tools or trying to combine your notes with quiz generation?"
    *   *If no:* "Why do you prefer to use a single tool, or what makes your current method efficient?"
2.  "Imagine a tool that could generate quizzes directly from your notes. How appealing does that sound to you, and why?"
3.  "What are your biggest challenges when it comes to preparing for exams or understanding complex lecture material?"

**IV. Feature Exploration & Feedback (10 minutes)**

*   "I'd like to describe some potential features for this website and get your initial thoughts."

1.  **Note-taking Interface:** "The website would include a rich text editor for taking notes, with basic formatting like bold, italics, lists, etc. What are the most important formatting or organizational features you'd need in such an editor?"
2.  **AI Quiz Generation:** "The core idea is an AI system that generates multiple-choice quizzes directly from your lecture notes or course content.
    *   "What are your expectations for the 'accuracy' and 'relevance' of such AI-generated quizzes?"
    *   "What would make an AI-generated quiz truly helpful for your learning?"
    *   "How comfortable would you be with an AI generating quizzes from your personal notes? What concerns, if any, come to mind?"
    *   "We're thinking of offering configurable quiz lengths (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 questions). Does this range sound appropriate, or would you prefer other options?"
3.  **Quiz Interface:** "When taking a quiz, you'd see one question at a time, get immediate feedback (correct/incorrect), and a final score.
    *   "What kind of feedback do you find most helpful during a quiz? Is just knowing if it's right or wrong enough, or would you want explanations, or even references back to your notes?"
    *   "Are multiple-choice questions your preferred quiz format, or would you also find other formats (e.g., true/false, fill-in-the-blank) useful?"

**V. "Nice to Have" Features (5 minutes)**

*   "Beyond the core features, we're considering some additional functionalities:"
    1.  "A to-do list/task manager for each course. How useful would this be for you?"
    2.  "The ability to upload lecture materials (PDFs, PowerPoints) to be included in quiz generation. Is this important?"
    3.  "Flashcard generation from notes. Would you use this?"
    4.  "A feature to share quizzes or flashcards with other students. How valuable is this?"
    *   *General Follow-up:* "Are there any other features or tools you wish you had that would significantly improve your study process?"

**VI. Closing (5 minutes)**

*   "Based on everything we've discussed, what's one thing you'd absolutely love to see in a website like this?"
*   "What's one thing that would make you hesitant to use such a website?"
*   "Thank you again for your time and valuable insights. Your feedback will be instrumental in shaping this project."
*   "Do you have any final questions for me?"
